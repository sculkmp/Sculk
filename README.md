## üìñ Introduction

Sculk is a high-performance server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, written entirely in Java. It aims to provide a robust and feature-rich alternative to existing server implementations, with a focus on scalability and ease of use.

> [!WARNING]
> Sculk is currently under development and is not yet ready for production use. We are actively working on implementing core features and improving stability. If you would like to contribute to the project, please see the [Contributing](#-contributing) section below.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Getting Started

To start using **Sculk**, add it to your project dependencies. Since **Sculk** is hosted on JitPack, you need to add the JitPack repository to your build configuration.

### Maven

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.sculkmp</groupId>
        <artifactId>Sculk</artifactId>
        <version>Tag</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Gradle
Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.sculkmp:Sculk:Tag'
}
```
