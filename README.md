## 📖 Introduction
Sculk is open source server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, It has a few key advantages over other server software:

## 🎯 Features
* Written in Java, Sculk is faster and more stable.
* We provided a high-level friendly API akin PocketMine plugin developers. Save yourself the hassle of dealing with the dot-and-cross of the low-level system API and hooks, we've done the difficult part for you!

## ✨ Creating plugins
Add Sculk to your dependencies *(it is hosted by JitPack, so you need to specify a custom repository)*.

For maven:
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.sculkmp</groupId>
        <artifactId>Sculk</artifactId>
        <version>Tag</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
For gradle:
```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.sculkmp:Sculk:Tag'
}
```
